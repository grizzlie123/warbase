Warbase — Next.js template (converted from static HTML)
======================================================

What this is
- A minimal Next.js project (App Router) containing your original Warbase landing page styling.
- Includes @vercel/analytics integration (additions already present in app/layout.js).
- Includes a Twitter banner placeholder at public/twitter-banner.png.

How to use (from Android / GitHub)
1. Download the ZIP and extract locally on your phone or desktop.
2. Upload the entire folder to your GitHub repository (replace existing repo contents).
   - From Android you can use the GitHub web UI or GitHub app to upload files, or use an app like Termux + git if you prefer.
3. In Vercel, import the GitHub repo and Deploy. Vercel will build automatically.
4. Visit Vercel dashboard → Project → Analytics to view traffic.

Notes
- This template includes a placeholder banner image. Replace public/twitter-banner.png with your real banner image of size ~1500x500 for Twitter.
- If you want me to change colors, fonts, or tweak layout, tell me and I'll update the ZIP.
